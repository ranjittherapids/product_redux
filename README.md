# React Redux Data Management

This project is a simple web application built using React and React Redux for data management. It allows users to add, remove, and display data using the power of React and state management provided by Redux.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow the instructions below:

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) should be installed on your system. You can download them from [here](https://nodejs.org/).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd react-redux-data-management
   ```

3. Install the project dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Usage

To run the application locally, use the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the development server, and you can access the application in your web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Functionality

The project provides the following functionality:

1. **Add Data:** Users can add new data entries. This data could represent anything you like, such as tasks, notes, items, etc. The added data will be displayed on the page.

3. **Show Data:** All the data entries are displayed on the page, making it easy for users to view and manage their data.
